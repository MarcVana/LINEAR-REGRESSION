# LINEAR-REGRESSION
The most simple model in the Machine Learning area. Made with sklearn, with an explained variance score of 0.9890. The metrics are shown in the console and a scatter plot is created.
The model is developed around a simple problem:
---------------------------------------------------------
A company hired you to find out what is more profitable: their app or website? Find out.
After developing the model, it can be seen that the app is more successful than the website. So, the company can either develop more the app, or they can start making their website better.
